          <h1>A ROT13 Encoder</h1>
          <p>ROT13 ("rotate by 13 places", sometimes hyphenated ROT-13)
            is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with
            the 13th letter after it, in the alphabet. ROT13 is a special case
            of the Caesar cipher which was developed in ancient Rome. Because
            there are 26 letters (2 x 13) in the basic Latin alphabet, ROT13 is
            its own inverse; that is, to undo ROT13, the same algorithm is
            applied, so the same action can be used for encoding and decoding.
             The algorithm provides virtually no cryptographic security, and is
              often cited as a canonical example of weak encryption</p>
