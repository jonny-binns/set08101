              Wōdejebato (formerly known as Sylvania) is a Cretaceous guyot or tablemount in the northern Marshall Islands, Pacific Ocean.
              Wōdejebato is probably a shield volcano and is connected through a submarine ridge to the smaller Pikinni Atoll 74 kilometres (46 mi)
               southeast of the guyot; unlike Wōdejebato, Pikinni rises above sea level. The seamount rises for 4,420 metres (14,500 ft) to 1,335 metres
               (4,380 ft) depth and is formed by basaltic rocks. The name Wōdejebato refers to a sea god of Pikinni.

              It was probably formed by a hotspot in what is present-day French Polynesia before plate tectonics moved it to its present-day location.
              The Macdonald, Rarotonga, Rurutu and Society hotspots may have been involved in its formation. The first volcanic phase took place in the
              Cenomanian and was followed by the formation of a carbonate platform that quickly disappeared below the sea. A second volcanic episode
               between 85 and 78.4 million years ago (in the Campanian) led to the formation of an island. This island was eventually eroded and rudist
               reefs generated an atoll or atoll-like structure, covering the former island with carbonates and thus a second carbonate platform.
